This package is used for ZZZ BSM study.

All the source codes are stored in "source_code" folder.
The final_state_study_4channels.C file is used for selecting final state and ee/mm/em/all channel study, seperately. The truth_level_study.C file is used for truth level 3 Zbosons study. The final_state_2F ( 1F2J / 4J ).C are used for 2fatjets ( 1fatjet+2jet / 4jets )
Either of them need to be copied and renamed as "ZZZAna.C" for use.
